## Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the solutions for the Projects 0,1,2,3,4 on the Course CS 188 of Berkeley University.

[Project 0 - Tutorial](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj0/)<br>
[Project 1 - Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj1/)<br>
[Project 2 - Multi-Agent Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj2/)<br>
[Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj3/)<br>
[Project 4 - Ghostbusters](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj4/)<br>
[Project 5 - Machine Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/proj5/)


The scores are:
- Project 0: 3/3
- Project 1: 25/25
- Project 2: 25/25
- Project 3: 25/25 (Q3 has a score of 5/6 but since Q4 is a bonus question and gives 1 extra credit it completes the missing credit)
- Project 4: 18/20 (I would appreciate, if someone can fork the repository and help me with Q4)
- Project 5: 18/25 (I would appreciate, if someone can fork the repository and help me with Q4)
